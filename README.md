## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "I want to create a yoga studio website inspired by the look and feel of Studio Ghibli films. The overall vibe should be peaceful, magical, and deeply connected to nature‚Äîlike stepping into a quiet, enchanted forest.

Use hand-drawn or illustrated elements that feel Ghibli-esque: soft skies, lush greenery, cozy indoor spaces, maybe even little spirit creatures subtly tucked into the design. The layout should feel open and airy, with warm, earthy colors like moss green, sky blue, soft beige, and muted pinks. Avoid anything too modern, glossy, or techy.

The typography should feel handcrafted and organic‚Äîsomething gentle and calming, like a rounded serif or brush-style font.

Include subtle, peaceful animations: drifting clouds, leaves falling, fireflies, or slow-moving nature scenes. It should feel alive, but never busy. Optional soft ambient music would be a nice touch, as long as there's a way to mute it‚Äîsomething like the peaceful background tracks from Spirited Away or Totoro.

The site should have:
	‚Ä¢	A calming welcome section with a hero image or animation and a short message like "Find stillness in motion"
	‚Ä¢	Class schedule
	‚Ä¢	Instructor bios
	‚Ä¢	Studio space overview (with cozy, illustrated interiors)
	‚Ä¢	Membership info
	‚Ä¢	Contact and booking section

The whole experience should feel like you're entering a calm, storybook world‚Äînot just another yoga website. Keep everything soothing, spacious, and intuitive."
